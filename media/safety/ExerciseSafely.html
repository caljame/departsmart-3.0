<h1>Staying Safe While Exercising in Public</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Run or walk with others. There is safety in numbers.</li>
    <li>Let someone know your route and when you expect to be back.</li>
    <li>Wear bright reflective clothing to help you stand out.</li>
    <li>Try to pick a route with houses or stores on both sides of the road and in areas with no heavy brush or woods that provide cover for thieves.</li>
    <li>Do not wear your hair in a ponytail when out exercising, since criminals can more easily latch on and grab or drag you.</li>
    <li>Do not run or walk in the dark.</li>
</ul>
