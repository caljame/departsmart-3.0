<h1>Air Pollution</h1>
<p>Air pollution varies widely throughout the world and is often severe in large cities. Many countries do not have basic vehicle emission controls; thus pollution from vehicles can be much worse than in the United States.</p>
<p>Other pollution may be more prevalent in other countries too, and there may be little, if any, regulation of those sources. Dusty, unpaved roads can be commonplace. Such pollution can contribute to respiratory irritation, predispose you to infection, or worsen chronic respiratory conditions.</p>
<h2>Take action to minimize health effects in dusty, polluted settings:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Limit time spent (and performing strenuous activities) outdoors.</li>
    <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief, surgical mask, or something similar to reduce inhalation of larger particles.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Air Quality Index (AQI)</h1>
<p>Air quality in some countries can now be monitored in AirNow.</p>
