<h1>Recreational Water Warnings</h1>
<p>Swallowing, inhaling droplets of, or having contact with recreational water that is treated such as in swimming pools and hot tubs/spas and untreated for example in lakes and oceans can cause a variety of illnesses. This is particularly of concern when disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) levels and pH are inadequately maintained in treated venues, or if human sewage or animal waste contaminates untreated venues.</p>
<h2>To help protect yourself:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Don’t swallow recreational water</li>
    <li>Don’t swim in untreated recreational water venues after heavy rains or if they smell bad; look discolored; have foam, scum, or algal mats on the surface; or contain or are near dead fish or other dead animals.</li>
    <li>Use pool test strips (available at superstores, hardware stores, and pool-supply stores) to check the disinfectant level and pH before getting into treated recreational water venues:</li>
    <li>Limit time spent (and performing strenuous activities) outdoors.</li>
    <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief, surgical mask, or something similar to reduce inhalation of larger particles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Waters in certain areas of the world contain free- swimming larvae of flukes which can penetrate human skin and cause Fascioliasis, an often chronic and debilitating disease. Fascioliasis is a parasitic infection typically caused by Fasciola hepatica, which is also known as “the common liver fluke” or “the sheep liver fluke.” Fascioliasis is found in all five continents, in over 50 countries, especially where sheep or cattle are reared.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar organisms, such as jellyfish, stinging coral, and biting or stinging fish, might also be present.</p>
