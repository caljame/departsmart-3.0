<h1>Tick Protection and Removal</h1>
<p>If you plan to visit wooded and bushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, discuss tick protection measures during your <b>pre-travel visit</b>.</p>
<p>To repel ticks, use repellents that contain 20 to 30% DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) on exposed skin and clothing for protection that lasts up to several hours. Always follow product instructions.</p>
<p>Treat clothing and gear, such as boots, pants, socks and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin. It remains protective through several washings. Look for pre-treated clothing - it can also be very effective at repelling ticks.</p>
<p>Travelers should inspect themselves and their clothing for ticks during outdoor activity and at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Prompt removal of attached ticks can prevent some infections. Showering within 2 hours of being in a tick-infested area reduces the risk of some tickborne diseases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you spot a tick on yourself or someone else, remove it with the tweezers from your travel kit as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible.</li>
    <li>Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don’t twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth- parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.</li>
    <li>After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol, an iodine scrub, or soap and water.</li>
    <li>Dispose of a live tick by submersing it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed bag/container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it down the toilet. Never crush a tick with your fingers.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>If you develop a rash or fever within several weeks of removing a tick, see your doctor. Be sure to tell the doctor about your recent tick bite, when the bite occurred, and where you most likely acquired the tick.</p>
