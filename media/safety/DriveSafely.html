<h1>Safe Driving Tips</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Keep doors locked and windows rolled up.</li>
    <li>Ensure cell phone is fully charged and operational.</li>
    <li>Pay close attention to your surroundings and the behavior of those around you at all times. Especially true when coming to a stop or an intersection.</li>
    <li>Leave ample space between your vehicle and the one in front in case you need to take evasive action.</li>
    <li>If followed or harassed by another driver, look for a safe place, such as a police station, hotel, or other crowded public facility.</li>
    <li>Never exit your vehicle to confront someone.</li>
    <li>Never lead a suspect to your home.</li>
    <li>Beware of strangers driving up alongside you trying to pull you over for some “emergency,” like a flat tire. Instead, drive to a service station or well-lit public area before checking your vehicle.</li>
    <li>Take on a low profile, be inconspicuous. For example, drive an older sedan instead of an expensive vehicle.</li>
    <li>Always keep your house keys and car keys separated. If you do lose your car, you will not automatically place your household possessions at risk.</li>
</ul>
