<h1>Employees’ Compensation Operations & Management Portal (ECOMP)</h1>
<p>A civil service federal employee, injured or ill while doing his or her job, may be eligible for
    compensation benefits under the Federal Employee’s Compensation Act (FECA).</p>
<p>The Employees’ Compensation Operations & Management Portal, known as ECOMP, is the system used by
    federal employees to file worker’s compensation claims with the Department of Labor (DOL). You
    can access training, forms and upload forms using this link: <a href="http://www.ecomp.dol.gov">http://www.ecomp.dol.gov</a>.
</p>
<h2>Filing an OSHA FORM 301</h2>
<h3>How Do I Get Started?</h3>
<p>First, register with the Department of Labor (DOL) by creating an account at <a
        href="www.ecomp.dol.gov">www.ecomp.dol.gov</a> using your email address. Next, complete an
    OSHA Form 301 to report your injury or illness from your Employee Dashboard. After submitting
    the 301, ECOMP will prompt you to complete a second form – your actual claim. ECOMP will
    automatically populate this second form with the information provided in the OSHA Form 301.</p>
<h3>Which form should you complete, the CA-1 or the CA-2?</h3>
<p>Your medical condition is either a traumatic injury OR an occupational disease. Choose the right
    category for your situation by looking at how long it took the medical condition to occur.</p>
<p>

<b>Traumatic Injury</b>
<p>Happens during one work shift and results from a single event.</p>
<p>Examples: cut, fall, sprain, fracture, animal bite, chemical splash, burn and needlestick.</p>

<p>
    <br/>
</p>
<h3>What Will I Need?</h3>
<p>You will need to have the following information to complete a claim form:
<ol>
    <li>Your government organization.</li>
    <li>Your supervisor’s email address.</li>
    <li>For new injury or illness claims, details about the event (including place, time, extent of
        injury, and the name and address of the doctor who treated your injury or illness).
    </li>
    <li>If you wish to continue on and submit an actual claim, have available supporting
        documentation (such as medical reports) in an electronic format.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Contacting Human Resources’ Worker’s Compensation Coordinators</h3>
<p>Worker’s Compensation Coordinators (WCC) will review and submit your claim forms in ECOMP after
    your supervisor reviews them. For more information on the worker’s compensation process, contact
    your WCC or visit the <a
