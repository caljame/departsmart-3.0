<h1>NIOSH Sound Level Meter App</h1>
<p>The NIOSH Sound Level Meter mobile application, Developed by experienced acoustics engineers and hearing loss experts, measures sound levels in the workplace and provides noise exposure parameters to help reduce occupational noise- induced hearing loss.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provides the most relevant metrics found in professional sound instruments today. Averages such as LAeq and TWA, Max and Peak Levels, Noise Dose and Projected Dose according to NIOSH and OSHA standards, and all three major weighting networks (A, C, and Z).</li>
    <li>Capability to calibrate either internal or external microphone. Reporting and Sharing data.</li>
    <li>Up-to-date informational screens on what noises are considered hazardous, how to conduct a noise measurement, how to properly select a hearing protector, and guidelines for preventing hearing loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Technical support available directly from NIOSH hearing experts.
</p>
<p>Tested and validated (accuracy ± 2 dBA) according to standards in a reverberant chamber at the NIOSH acoustics lab – the only proper method to validate accuracy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meets Type 2 requirements of IEC 61672:3 SLM standard when used w/ external microphone.</p>
