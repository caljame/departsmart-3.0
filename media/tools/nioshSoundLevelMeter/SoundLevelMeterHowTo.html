<h1>Interpreting Results</h1>
<p>NIOSH establishes recommended exposure limits (REL) for various hazards on the basis of the best
    available science and practice.</p>
<p>The REL for noise is 85 decibels, using the A-weighting frequency response an 8-hour average,
    usually referred to as time-weighted average (TWA). Exposures at or above this level are
    considered hazardous.</p>
<p>The legally-enforceable permissible exposure limit (PEL), set by OSHA, requires employers take
    actions to reduce worker exposures. The OSHA PEL for noise is 90 dB(A) as an 8-hr TWA based on a
    5-dB exchange rate.</p>
<p>Occupational standards specify a maximum allowable daily noise dose, expressed in percentages.
    For example, a person continuously exposed to 85 dB(A) per NIOSH or 90 dB(A) per OSHA over an
    8-hour work shift, will reach 100% of their daily noise dose. The noise dose is based on both
    the sound exposure level and how long it lasts (duration). This dose limit uses a 3-dB
    time-intensity tradeoff commonly referred to as the exchange rate or equal-energy rule: for
    every 3-dB increase in averaged noise exposure, the allowable exposure time is reduced by half.
    For example, if the exposure increases to 88 dB(A), workers should only be exposed for four
    hours. Alternatively, for every 3-dB decrease in averaged noise exposure, the allowable exposure
    time is doubled, as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>It is important to differentiate between noise level and time-weighted average noise exposure.
    While noise levels describe the intensity of sounds at a given point in time, the NIOSH exposure
    limits are set as time-weighted average exposures over periods of time.</p>
<p>If noise level measurements consistently exceed 85 dB(A), we recommend that you follow up with an
    industrial hygienist in the Occupational Safety and Health Office, OSSAM to conduct a noise
    survey at your workplace.</p>
