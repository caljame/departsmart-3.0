    prior to departure to ensure you have what you need to keep yourself safe and healthy.</p>

<p>If you are an employee assigned outside of Atlanta and Ft. Collins, you can call the OHC for a
    telephonic pre-travel visit and referrals for any necessary CDC-covered services (at no cost to
    you).</p>

</p>

    <li>Review medical history/status, prior travel experiences, etc.</li>

    <li>Receive appropriate immunizations, prophylaxes, post-exposure guidance, and treatments.</li>

    <b>Past Medical History and Personal Health</b>
</p>
<p>Your past medical history and current health can affect your fitness for international travel.
    Some staff members should not travel to areas of increased risk or limited medical resources to
    treat what is, in the United States, a manageable medical condition. If you have concerns about
    your fitness for travel to a particular destination, discuss them with the clinic staff or your
    travel medicine provider.</p>
<p>If you still have concerns after the pre-travel visit, discuss them with your personal health
    care provider.</p>
<p>
    <b>Consider the following and discuss with health care advisors:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>DO NOT travel until your health improves, if you have a significant acute, evolving,
        worsening, or undiagnosed condition or an inadequately controlled chronic disease.
    </li>
    <li>DO NOT travel now, if you recently had surgery or have been told you need surgery or a
        diagnostic procedure.
    </li>
    <li>Discuss the possibility of taking a supply of medication with you, if you are taking any
        prescription medications (including as-needed medications such as inhalers or creams).
    </li>
</ul>
