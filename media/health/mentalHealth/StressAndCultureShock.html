<h1>Your Mental Health While Traveling</h1>
<p>Almost everyone experiences some travel-related stress which is defined as a mentally or emotionally disruptive or upsetting condition occurring in response to adverse external influences.</p>
<h2>STRESS</h2>
<p>Stress is capable of affecting physical health, which may be characterized by increased heart rate, and/or depression. Stress can be caused by many factors and may have a variety of symptoms. A limited amount of stress may be motivating and positive, but excessive or long-term stress can cause difficulty.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of stress can include:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Anxiety</li>
    <li>Feeling easily frustrated or angered</li>
    <li>Feeling overwhelmed</li>
    <li>General sense of uneasiness</li>

    <li>Feeling isolated or homesick</li>
    <li>Emotional numbness</li>
    <li>Disorientation or confusion</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
</ul>
<h2>If may be easier to cope with stress if you:</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Continue communicating with colleagues and supervisors</li>
    <li>Incorporate routines and planned activities into your day</li>

</ul>
<h2>Culture shock</h2>
<p>Culture shock is a very common source of stress for international travelers. It is the combined effect of the stressors of a new culture.</p>
<h2>Culture shock can arise from any or all of the following:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Being in an unfamiliar situation</li>
    <li>Feeling a sense of loss or separation from loved ones</li>
    <li>Worry about rejection and loss of control</li>
    <li>Confusion over your role or purpose</li>
    <li>Anxiety, disgust, or shock over cultural beliefs and practices</li>
    <li>Other difficulties in coping with the new environment</li>
</ul>
<h1>Managing Culture Shock</h1>
<p>Your attitude and approach to your work are important in managing culture shock effectively. First, be an observer; do all you can to get to know local people and find out what their lives are really like. Adapting to a new environment will be easier, and your work will probably go more smoothly and be more rewarding.</p>
<h1>When and How to Ask for Help</h1>
<p>If you experience mental health difficulties while traveling, donâ€™t keep it to yourself. This may only worsen the problem, and you may begin to further isolate yourself from others. Know that it is appropriate to speak up. Ask for help if your symptoms bother you or are persistent.</p>
<h2>Symptoms to watch for include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An uncomfortable, persistent level of anxiety</li>
<li>Panic attacks</li>
<li>Depression signs such as crying, sadness, hopelessness</li>
<li>Being psychologically unable to accomplish simple tasks</li>
<li>Frequent, uncontrollable outbursts of anger</li>
<li>Excessive fear for your safety that impedes work</li>
<li>Having continual thoughts and fears that you know are not based in reality</li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you may need to seek professional help. Consider sharing your symptoms with a travel partner, your host, or your supervisor. You may also call the CDC Employee Assistance Program (EAP).</p>
<p>Many international sites also have local Employee Assistance Program services. If your symptoms become urgent in nature, get help immediately from a credible source of health care.</p>
