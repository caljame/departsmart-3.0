<h1>Leaving Your Assignment</h1>
<p>Travelers on short tours of duty often transition back to their normal routine without
    difficulty. However, travelers away for a long period of time may have negative emotions when
    it’s time to come home. Some of the feelings returning travelers have experienced are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of closure in not being able to complete a project</li>
    <li>Regret over not having accomplished more</li>
    <li>Anger from a perceived lack of appreciation or recognition</li>
    <li>Disappointment over returning to routine work</li>
    <li>Estrangement from family, peers, and position at home</li>
    <li>Overwhelmed about work that has accumulated</li>
    <li>Sadness or depression over the loss of positive experiences and relationships</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Experiencing such negative feelings is usually normal.</p>
<h2>Some ideas to help you handle them are:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Say goodbye to those who were significant</li>
    <li>Find ways to keep in touch with significant people</li>
    <li>Review your expectations for the assignment</li>
    <li>Share your feelings with a travel partner or supervisor</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Successful Transition Home</h1>
<p>It’s important to create a transition period for yourself rather than to jump “feet first” back
    into your regular position. Set a realistic timetable for catching up on emails and work that
    has accumulated. Think about who you will contact when you return and how you will reconnect
    fully with family and friends outside of work.</p>
<p>Because the international travel experience is often powerful, talk with other people who have
    traveled to the same country. Most travelers find it a positive experience when they compare and
    contrast their perceptions. Many find that their values have changed and that their view of the
    world has been permanently altered. Discussing your experience with someone who understands and
    can validate what you have been through will often allow you to make a smoother transition home.
    If your transition does not go as well as expected, call the Employee Assistance Program
    (EAP).</p>
<p>Local resources for non-Atlanta employees are readily available.</p>
<h1>Medical Issues on Returning</h1>
<p>Safe, healthy travel requires careful follow-up after you come home. Malaria and other
    travel-related illnesses can present themselves days or months after you were exposed. Make sure
    that you: Complete all of your travel medications as directed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Continue taking anti-malarial prophylaxis until it is finished</li>
    <li>If indicated, get a tuberculosis (TB) test at the CDC Clinic or from your personal health
        care provider 6 to 8 weeks after return
    </li>
    <li>Call the CDC Clinic to report any travel-related concerns</li>
    <li>Seek medical help for any unusual or unexplained illness or symptoms that develop after your
        return
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Some travel related to disease investigations or other public health challenges may require post-
    travel interventions, such as laboratory testing or other temporary work limitations.</p>
<p>This will be discussed with you during your pre- travel visit or communicated to you by your
    supervisor before, during, or after travel.</p>
