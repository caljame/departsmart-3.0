<h1>Health Care Coverage for Overseas Travel and Deployments</h1>
<h2>Employees* are responsible for personal health care costs when deployed overseas.</h2>
<p>CDC is not authorized to act as a primary payer for any employee’s personal health care costs,
    and is only authorized to act as a secondary payer for employees with Department of State (DOS)
    medical clearance and for employees on official travel orders for short-term temporary duty
    (TDY).</p>
<h2>DOS Medical Bureau (MED) Services and Financial Responsibility for Medical Care</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>DOS provides employees medical care at the embassy clinic or refers employees to appropriate
        care.
    </li>
    <li>Employees receive secondary payer benefits (minus deductibles and co-pays) for health care
        costs associated with a qualifying hospitalization (overseas/overnight/in- patient stay)
        when there is a primary payer source such as personal health insurance.
    </li>
    <li><b>Employees may need to pay up-front medical costs for medical treatment. For an in-patient
        hospital stay, the embassy may provide a payment letter of guarantee when the employee has
        primary health insurance coverage or signs a repayment agreement.</b></li>
    <li>Employees are responsible for medical costs when they do not have medical insurance, when
        they have medical insurance that denies primary coverage, and when they are not eligible for
        workers’ compensation benefits. In these cases, employees may need to pay up- front medical
        costs for medical treatment.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Personal Health Care Insurance and International Coverage</h2>
<p>Employees’ personal health insurance is for non- work-related illness, injuries, and personal
    health needs on overseas deployments. We encourage you to verify the status of your health
    insurance coverage prior to departing for an overseas TDY, and to purchase supplementary
    insurance plans through commercial vendors when current health insurance plans do not provide
    international coverage.</p>
<p>Some illnesses or injuries that occur while traveling overseas for work are not work- related.
    Additional information on what constitutes work-related injuries and illnesses, how to report
    them, and how civil servants file a workers compensation claim is located in the Workers’
    Compensation section.</p>
<h2>Commercial Providers of Short-Term Supplemental Overseas Health Insurance</h2>
<p>Several commercial providers offer short-term supplemental health insurance to overseas
    travelers. More information is available at

<h2>What to Ask Your Insurance Company about International Coverage</h2>
<p>Look for insurers that answer “yes” to the following questions about international coverage
    benefits.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does this insurance policy cover emergency expenses abroad such as returning me to the
        United States for treatment if I become seriously ill or injured?
    </li>
    <li>If yes, will the policy cover expenses to travel back to the United States, or is coverage
        only to reach the nearest adequate medical care?
    </li>
    <li>Will this policy support emergency medical evacuation, regardless of where I am in-country
        at the time of the injury or illness?
    </li>
    <li>Does this policy cover high-risk activities such as parasailing, mountain climbing, scuba
        diving, and off-roading?
    </li>
    <li>Does this policy cover pre-existing conditions?</li>
    <li>Does the insurance company require pre- authorizations or second opinions before emergency
        treatment can begin?
    </li>
    <li>Does the insurance company guarantee medical payments abroad?</li>
    <li>Will the insurance company pay foreign hospitals and foreign doctors directly?</li>
    <li>Does the insurance company have a 24-hour physician-backed support center?</li>
</ul>
