<h1>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</h1>
<p>Deep vein thrombosis (or deep venous thrombosis) affects mainly veins in the lower leg and thigh.
    It involves the formation of a clot (thrombus) in the larger veins of the area. The thrombus may
    interfere with circulation of the area, and it may break off and travel through the bloodstream
    (embolize). The embolus thus created can lodge in the lungs, heart, or other area, causing
    severe illness that could potentially be lethal.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Risks include prolonged sitting, bedrest or immobilization (such as on long plane or car trips),
    recent surgery or trauma (especially hip, knee, or gynecological surgery), childbirth within the
    last six months, and the use of medications such as estrogen and birth control pills.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Walk around frequently during long car, plane, or train trips.</li>
    <li>If you must remain seated, continue to move your legs and feet, and rotate your ankles
        frequently.
    </li>
    <li>Contract and relax calf and leg muscles frequently to stimulate the movement of blood
        throughout legs and thighs.
    </li>
    <li>Stay well hydrated.</li>
    <li>Avoid excess caffeine, excess alcohol, and sedatives.</li>
    <li>Consider purchasing compression socks or hose (such as those used for air travel).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Leg pain or tenderness (almost always in one leg only).</li>
    <li>Calf tenderness with ankle movement or when bearing weight.</li>
    <li>Redness or change in skin color of one leg.</li>
    <li>Increased warmth of one leg.</li>
    <li>Swelling of only one leg.</li>
</ul>
