<h1>Altitude Illness</h1>
<p>If you travel to destinations above 4,000–6,000 feet (~1,200 –1,800 meters), you should know the
    risks of altitude illness. This illness usually presents as one of three syndromes: acute
    mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), or high- altitude pulmonary edema
    (HAPE). You may find more details regarding the symptoms of these syndromes on the following
    page. AMS is the most common syndrome, occurring most commonly during abrupt ascents to
    altitudes above 9,000 feet (~2,740 meters), although it can occur at altitudes as low as 4,000
    feet (~1,200 meters). HACE is considered a severe progression
    of AMS. HAPE may occur by itself or in conjunction with HACE.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>You may or may not be susceptible to altitude illness; there are no tests that predict whether or
    not you will experience it.
    The most reliable indicator of how you might respond to high altitudes is your response on a
    previous trip to a high altitude destination (if you have been on such a trip.)</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Learn the early symptoms of altitude illness. If you have any of them, seek medical help.
    </li>
    <li>Do not go to sleep while ascending when experiencing any of the symptoms of altitude
        illness, no matter how minor they seem.
    </li>
    <li>Plan a gradual ascent, with extra rest days at intermediate altitudes.</li>
    <li>Descend if symptoms worsen while resting at the same altitude.</li>
    <li>Depending upon your destination, you may be given medication to take during your stay at
        high elevations to prevent altitude illness.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms of Altitude Illness</h2>
<p>AMS onset is delayed, usually starting 6–12 hours after arrival at a higher altitude, but
    occasionally more than 24 hours after ascent. AMS symptoms resemble those of an alcohol-induced
    hangover:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
</ul>
<p>HACE, a progression of AMS, may present with the following symptoms in addition to the symptoms
    of AMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lethargy</li>
    <li>Confusion</li>
    <li>Loss of ability to coordinate muscular movement</li>
</ul>
<p>HAPE symptoms are increased breathlessness with exertion and, eventually, increased
    breathlessness at rest.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>An immediate descent may be necessary, especially if symptoms of HACE or HAPE occur. Take
    medications to prevent and treat altitude illness only as directed by your health care
    provider.</p>
