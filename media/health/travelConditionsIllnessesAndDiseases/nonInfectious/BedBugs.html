<h1>Bed Bugs</h1>
<h2>What are bed bugs?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are small, flat parasitic insects that feed solely on the blood of people and animals while they sleep. Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, wingless, range from 1mm to 7mm (roughly the size of Lincoln’s head on a penny), and can live several months without a blood meal.</p>
<h2>What are the signs and symptoms of a bed bug infestation?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tell-tale bite marks on the face, neck, arms, hands, or any other body parts while sleeping.</li>
    <li>Bed bugs in the folds of mattresses and sheets.</li>
    <li>Rusty-colored blood spots due to their blood-filled fecal material that they excrete on the mattress or nearby furniture.</li>
    <li>A sweet, musty odor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Do bed bugs spread disease?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs should not be considered as a medical or public health hazard. Bed bugs are not known to spread disease. Bed bugs can be an annoyance because their presence may cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes the itching can lead to excessive scratching that can increase the chance of a secondary skin infection.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The first step is to get the bed bugs before they get you!</li>
    <li>When arriving at your hotel, inspect the mattress and linens for tell-tale signs of infestation – blood spots and fecal matter.</li>
    <li>Additional measures can be taken to avoid bringing bed bugs home with you:
        <ul>
            <li>Never leave luggage open or on beds or floors. </li>
            <li>Keep it closed and stored on racks away from walls.</li>
            <li>Use luggage that has hard sides. Bed bugs love the softness of cloth. To be extra cautious, keep most of your items, especially personal items, inside a zipped plastic bag.</li>
            <li>When you come back home, be sure to inspect your suitcase and clothes. Be sure not to unpack your suitcase on your bed. In addition, when you remove your clothes, put them quickly into a large zipped plastic bag and leave them there until they can be washed. Wash the clothes in hot water if possible and if it will not ruin the fabric.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>The best way to treat a bite is to avoid scratching the area and applying antiseptic creams or lotions. Unless it is medically contraindicated, an oral antihistamine can help alleviate the itching. Sometimes the itching can lead to excessive scratching that can increase the chance of a secondary skin infection. Seek medical assistance if you have swelling, redness, discharge, or a fever.</p>
