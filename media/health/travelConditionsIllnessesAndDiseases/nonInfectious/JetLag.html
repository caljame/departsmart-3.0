    contributing to jet lag include the dry air and pressurization of plane cabins, preflight
    fatigue, lack of exercise during the flight, and alcohol consumption.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Risk increases with the numbers of time zones crossed.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>

    <li>Drink plenty of fluids the day before a flight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>During the Flight</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain a regular sleep schedule during the flight.</li>
    <li>Avoid too much caffeine or alcohol while traveling.</li>
</ul>
