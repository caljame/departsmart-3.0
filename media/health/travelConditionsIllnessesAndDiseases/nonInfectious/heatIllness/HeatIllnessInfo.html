<h1>Heat Illnesses</h1>
Excessive heat and humidity or strenuous activity under hot, humid conditions can lead to heat cramps, severe muscle cramps caused by salt, and water deficiency. If fluids and minerals are not replaced fast enough, the body’s thermoregulation system can overheat, and the progressively more serious conditions of heat exhaustion and heat stroke may develop.
<h2>Risk</h2>
Highest risk areas include tropical and subtropical areas of the world.
