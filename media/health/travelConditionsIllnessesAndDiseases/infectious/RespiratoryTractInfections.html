<h1>Respiratory Tract Infections</h1>
<p>Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, but can be caused by bacteria and other
    organisms. Infections vary in severity.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Respiratory tract infections may be more common in areas where allergens, dust, and other
    respiratory tract irritants predispose persons to infection such as areas with large amounts of
    outdoor pollution, dust, or other harsh conditions. Crowded areas such as airports and busy
    markets may also increase risks.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wash hands often, especially before touching your or anotherâ€™s face, nose, or mouth, and
        before eating.
    </li>
    <li>Certain vaccinations (influenza and pneumococcal) may decrease the risk of respiratory
        infections.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Cough</li>

    <li>Post-nasal drip</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath</li>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mild symptoms may be treated with over- the-counter cough and cold medications, analgesics,
        and increased fluids.
    </li>
    <li>Respiratory symptoms with chest pain and high fever should prompt immediate medical
        evaluation from a credible health care provider.
