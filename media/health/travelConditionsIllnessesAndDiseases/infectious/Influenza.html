<h1>Influenza</h1>
<p>Influenza (the “flu”) is caused by infection with either Influenza A or B virus of varied subtypes. Seasonal epidemics occur in many areas of the world on a regular basis.</p>

    <li>Vaccination is recommended annually, especially for travelers who are at increased risk of flu complications.</li>
    <li>Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially after using a restroom, changing a diaper, or before preparing or eating food.</li>
    <li>Unvaccinated, exposed persons at high risk of flu complications should consider post- exposure treatment with antiviral medications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and sequelae</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Malaise</li>
    <li>Cough</li>

    <li>Pneumonia</li>
    <li>Worsening of chronic heart or lung conditions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>

    or if shortness of breath develops.</p>
