<h1>Japanese Encephalitis</h1>
<p>Japanese encephalitis is a common mosquito- borne viral encephalitis (an inflammation or irritation and swelling of the brain with the presence of extra immune cells).</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Risk to short-term and urban area travelers is very low. Transmission occurs mainly in rural, agricultural areas during summer and autumn in temperate regions of China, Japan, Korea and eastern Russia.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Vaccination is recommended for travelers to endemic areas for prolonged periods of time or during certain seasons of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and sequelae</h2>
<p>Symptoms may develop from 6 days after initial exposure to several months after departure from an endemic area. Most infections are asymptomatic; however, any of these symptoms may occur:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
