<h1>Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</h1>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases are the infections and resulting clinical syndromes that can be
    spread through sexual activity.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Any sexually active person can get an STD through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If you are sexually active,
    you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting an STD:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and
        has negative STD test results.
    </li>
    <li>Using latex condoms the right way every time.</li>
    <li>Vaccines are safe, effective, and recommended to prevent hepatitis B and human
        papillomavirus (HPV).
    </li>
    <li>Reducing your number of sex partners decreases your risk for STDs. It is still important for
        you and your partner to get tested and you share your test results with one another.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and complications</h2>
<p>STDs often have no symptoms, especially in women. Signs and symptoms also vary depending on the
    STD. If you have an STD, you may experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An abnormal vaginal discharge (women) or discharge from the penis (men)</li>
    <li>Abdominal or pelvic pain</li>
    <li>Rash or sores in the genital area</li>
    <li>A burning sensation when urinating</li>
    <li>Serious complications can include:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</li>
        <li>Cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers</li>
        <li>Inability to get pregnant</li>
        <li>Pregnancy complications</li>
        <li>Some STDs can make it easier for you to get or transmit HIV</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>If you might have been exposed to an STD, have an honest and open talk with your health care
    provider to find out whether you should be tested and treated.</p>
