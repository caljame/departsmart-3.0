<h1>Malaria</h1>
<p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne, life-threatening disease caused by Anopheles mosquitoes, which bite from dusk to dawn (nighttime). A major public health problem in many areas of the world, it causes up to 500 million deaths annually. Even with good prevention efforts, you may still be at risk for contracting malaria.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Ask your travel medicine provider about your risk for malaria infection at your specific destination.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Preventative prophylaxis is required of travelers to malaria-endemic areas</li>
    <li>Use prophylaxis correctly and consistently</li>
    <li>Continue taking it on return from travel until it is gone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and sequelae</h2>
<p>Symptoms may develop from 6 days after initial exposure to several months after departure from malaria-endemic areas. Symptoms can also occur after treatments have been discontinued.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Chills</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Malaise</li>
    <li>Muscle pain</li>
    <li>Anemia</li>
    <li>Mental confusion</li>
    <li>Seizures</li>
    <li>Jaundice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>The CDC clinic or a travel medicine provider may prescribe malaria self-treatment to be used only as needed. Self-treatment should be taken only if you have a fever, chills, or other flu-like symptoms and prompt medical care will not be available within 24 hours. Medical advice should still be sought as soon as possible after self-treatment.</p>
