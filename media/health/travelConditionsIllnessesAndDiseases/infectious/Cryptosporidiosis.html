<h1>Cryptosporidiosis</h1>
<p>Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection caused by Cryptosporidium parvum, and, occasionally, by other species of Cryptosporidium.
    It is transmitted by ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water, including water swallowed while swimming; exposure to fecally contaminated environmental surfaces, and by the fecal-oral route from person to person (e.g. while changing diapers, caring for an infected person, or engaging in certain sexual behaviors).</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Cryptosporidiosis occurs worldwide. Risk of infection is highest for those with greatest exposures to potentially contaminated food or water.</p>
<p><i>Immunocompromised Travelers Note: be vigilant to avoid cryptosporidiosis. Your risk of complications is higher than for others.</i></p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>Immunocompromised travelers must ensure that water they drink is disinfected in such a way so that it kills Cryptosporidium oocysts.</p>
<p>Ask your health care provider for additional assistance.</p>
<h2>Symptoms and Sequelae</h2>
<p>Symptoms typically last from 6â€“10 days, but may last up to several weeks. Symptoms include:</p>

<p>Persons with severely weakened immune systems may experience chronic, severe, or fatal infection.</p>
