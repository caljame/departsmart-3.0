<h1>Travelers’ Diarrhea</h1>
<p>Travelers’ diarrhea is the most common illness affecting international travelers. It is acquired
    through ingestion of food or water (or both) that has been contaminated with various disease-
    causing organisms. Highest risk areas include most parts of Asia, Africa, Central and South
    America, and parts of the Caribbean. In otherwise healthy adults, diarrhea is rarely serious or
    life- threatening, but it can certainly make for an unpleasant trip or “souvenir.” The most
    ardent traveler and the traveler that throws caution to the wind are both at risk for travelers’
    diarrhea.</p>
<h2>Decreasing Your Risk</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Follow good hand washing practices. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially
        after using the bathroom and before eating even a snack. If soap and water are not
        available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
    </li>
    <li>Often, food handlers are riskier than the food you choose to eat. Subsequently, where you
        eat is more important than what you eat.
    </li>
    <li>Eat food that is thoroughly cooked and served hot.</li>
    <li>Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if they can be peeled or have been soaked in bleach and
        rinsed with clean water.
    </li>
    <li>Drink water and other beverages from factory- sealed containers. If possible, open your own
        bottle to ensure it has a proper seal.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid ice.</li>
    <li>Drink only pasteurized dairy products.</li>
    <li>Use bottled water for brushing teeth.</li>
    <li>Keep mouth closed in the shower/when bathing.</li>
    <li>Avoid raw fruits and vegetables served on flights as the origin of these products may not be
        known.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep hydrated! At the first sign of diarrhea, begin fluid replacement to avoid dehydration.
        This is significant for young children and adults with chronic illnesses. Oral rehydration
        salts are one of the best choices for fluid replacements. Mix it according to the
        directions, and drink at room temperature in small, frequent amounts. Seek medical
        assistance for signs of dehydration such as lightheadedness, nausea, dizziness, or decreased
        urine output.
    </li>
    <li>Take an antibiotic. Your travel kit contains Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or Azithromycin. At the
        first sign of diarrhea, begin treatment according to the package directions. Stop taking the
        antibiotic once the diarrhea resolves. Note that Flagyl (Metronidazole) is used for
        treatment of giardiasis.
    </li>
    <li>Over-the-counter medications. Drugs such as Lomotil, Imodium®, or Pepto-Bismol® can be used
        to decrease the frequency and urgency of needing to use the bathroom and can make it easier
        to travel or get rest. These medications can be taken along with antibiotics.
    </li>
    <li>DO NOT use these over-the-counter medications if you have fever associated with diarrhea,
        blood or mucous in the stool, or significant abdominal discomfort/pain.
    </li>
    <li>Be aware that Pepto-Bismol® can temporarily turn the tongue black and cause dark-colored
        stool. It should not be taken by pregnant women or those with aspirin allergies and should
        be spaced out with antibiotic use.
    </li>
</ul>
