<h1>Human Immunodeficiency Virus
    (HIV)</h1>
<p>HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired
    immunodeficiency syndrome – AIDS. Unlike some other viruses, the human body cannot get rid of
    HIV. That means that once you have HIV, you have it for life. HIV is caused by a virus that is
    transmitted through activities that involve contact with blood or blood-derived body fluids.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Overall risk is low with avoidance of certain high-risk activities such as by having unprotected
    sex with or sharing drug injection equipment with someone who is infected with HIV. Risk factors
    for HIV infection are similar to those of Hepatitis B and C.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>Be aware of higher-risk behaviors.</p>
<ul>
    <li>DO NOT share needles.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of cuts or open wounds, and avoid exposure to blood or body fluids.</li>
    <li>Always use condoms, a dental dam, or other barrier when engaging in sexual contact.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and sequelae</h2>
<p>Symptoms can mimic influenza and other viral illnesses 2–4 weeks after exposure and can last a
    few days to several weeks.</p>
<p>The infection can lay dormant for many years, and the only way to detect the disease is by
    testing.</p>
<p>In advanced infection, HIV can progress to AIDS and cause immune system compromise and
    opportunistic infections leading to severe disease and death.</p>
