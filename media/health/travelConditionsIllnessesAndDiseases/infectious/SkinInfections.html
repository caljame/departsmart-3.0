<h2>Skin Infections</h2>
<p>Skin infections may be caused by traumatic bites, scratches, abrasions, or other injury when bacteria, fungal elements,
    or viruses enter skin.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Warm, humid conditions can aggravate athlete’s foot, ringworm, or yeast infections. Dry or dusty environmental conditions also can increase the risk of other skin infections.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>Keep skin dry if you are in warm, humid conditions, and clean and moisturized if you are in dry or dusty conditions.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Redness</li>
    <li>Rash</li>
    <li>Blistering</li>
    <li>Pain</li>
    <li>Swelling</li>
    <li>Discharge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clean cuts, scrapes, and scratches promptly and thoroughly with warm, soapy water for 5–10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Symptoms of minor localized or limited infections may heal on their own, but should be monitored closely. Topical antibacterial or antifun-gal ointments or creams may help speed healing.</li>
    <li>Infections that are larger, persistent, worsening, or accompanied by fever should be promptly evaluated.</li>
</ul>
