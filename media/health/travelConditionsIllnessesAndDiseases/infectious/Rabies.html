<h1>Rabies</h1>
<p>Rabies is an acute, fatal encephalomyelitis caused by viruses and almost always transmitted by an
    animal bite.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Dogs are the main source of rabies in resource-poor countries. Bats and other carnivores are also
    potential sources.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be in certain areas of risk for prolonged
        periods of time.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid contact with local domestic or wild animals.</li>
    <li>Ensure that sleeping areas are well- protected from bats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and sequelae</h2>
<p>Symptoms of rabies infection include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spasms of swallowing muscles stimulated by the sight, sound, or perception of water
        (hydrophobia)
    </li>
    <li>Delirium</li>
    <li>Convulsions</li>
</ul>
<p>Sequelae include paralysis, coma, and death.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wash animal bite with soap and running water or povidone-iodine solution for at least 20
        minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Contact local health authorities to evaluate you or the affected person for rabies
        post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For any mammal bite received during international travel, get prompt medical evaluation for
    potential rabies exposure from the nearest credible source of health care. This advice applies
    even if you received the pre-exposure rabies series.</p>
