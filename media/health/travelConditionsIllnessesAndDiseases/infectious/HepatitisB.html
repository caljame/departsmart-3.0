<h1>Hepatitis B</h1>
<p>Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by a virus that is transmitted through activities that
    involve contact with blood or blood- derived fluids as well as other body fluids, such as
    semen.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>Overall risk is low, except for certain travelers to areas where chronic hepatitis B virus
    infection prevalence is high or intermediate.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>Vaccination is strongly recommended if travel is to areas of intermediate to high levels of
    endemic transmission.</p>
<h2>Symptoms and sequelae</h2>
<p>Symptoms range from none at all to a mild illness lasting 1â€“2 weeks to a severe, life-
    threatening liver disease. Some people, especially adults, are able to clear the infection over
    time. Others, especially infants and young children, often develop a chronic or lifelong
    infection.</p>
<p>Symptoms of acute and chronic hepatitis B infection are the same and can include one or more of
    the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Malaise</li>
    <li>Poor appetite</li>
    <li>Abdominal discomfort</li>
    <li>Jaundice (yellow skin/eyes) after a few days</li>
    <li>Dark urine</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential sequelae of becoming chronically infected include liver disease, scarring or cirrhosis
    of the liver, and liver cancer.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>No specific treatment is available for acute illness caused by hepatitis B. Supportive care,
    rest, adequate hydration, and medications to treat symptoms may be useful. Chronic hepatitis B
    infection can be treated with antivirals.</p>
