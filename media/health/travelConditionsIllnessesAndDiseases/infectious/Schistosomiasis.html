<h1>Schistosomiasis</h1>
<p>Schistosomiasis is caused by flukes, whose complex life cycles involve certain freshwater
    snails as intermediate hosts. Infected snails release free-swimming larvae that can
    penetrate unbroken human skin. Even brief exposure to contaminated freshwater, such as
    wading, swimming, or bathing, can result in infection.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>South America, Africa, Middle East, China, India, other Asian countries, and Irian Jaya
    (western half of New Guinea).</p>
<p>The highest prevalence is in Brazil, sub- Saharan Africa, southern China, and the Philippines
    are areas of higher risk.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>Infested and non-infested waters are difficult to distinguish; therefore, avoid freshwater
    wading or swimming if your destination is an endemic country. Swimming pools in an endemic
    country are typically safe, if pool water is adequately chlorinated. Ask your host for local
    advice.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Although symptoms can occur up to 3 weeks after exposure, most acute infections are
    asymptomatic. The most common acute syndrome is Katayama Fever. Symptoms of Katayama Fever
    include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Abdominal pain</li>
    <li>Diarrhea</li>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Blood in urine</li>
    <li>Joint and muscle pain</li>
    <li>Weight loss</li>
    <li>Cough</li>
</ul>
<p>Chronic infections can cause disease in the intestinal tract, bladder, liver, kidneys, or
    lungs.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>Medications are available to treat schistosomiasis. If needed, consult an infectious disease
    specialist or tropical medicine specialist.</p>
