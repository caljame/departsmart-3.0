<h1>Dengue Fever</h1>
<p>Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes, which typically bite
    from dawn to dusk (during the day). An estimated 50–100 million cases occur each year
    worldwide.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>This disease is rapidly expanding in most tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<h3>Symptoms and sequelae</h3>
<p>Symptoms most commonly appear 4–7 days after being bitten by an Aedes aegypti mosquito.</p>
<ul>
    <li>High fever</li>
    <li>Severe frontal headache</li>
    <li>Joint and muscle pain</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Rash</li>
    <li>Retro-orbital pain (pain behind the eyes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dengue can also present as the severe, sometimes fatal, dengue hemorrhagic fever.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Take acetaminophen (not aspirin) products to manage fever.</li>
    <li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li>
    <li>Rest.</li>
    <li>Seek prompt infusion of intravenous fluids (in severe cases).</li>
    <li>DO NOT take acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-tory agents (such
        as ibuprofen), because of their anticoagulant properties, which could potentially worsen
        dengue hemorrhagic fever.
