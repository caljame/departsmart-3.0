<h1>Deployment Medical Clearance</h1>
<h2>CDC Deployment</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Certain employees deploying through the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) may be required to
        obtain CDC Deployment Medical Clearance through the OHC. Appointments will include a
        physical examination and a review of each deployee’s medical history. Respirator clearance
        will also be provided if appropriate. All deployees will also be scheduled for a travel
        visit, during which they will receive any vaccinations, medications and guidance needed for
        travel to their specific destination. For travel to locations (international or domestic)
        where there is an ongoing public health emergency, you may need additional (more stringent)
        medical clearance and testing. Once completed, your CDC OHC Deployment Medical Clearance is
        valid for one
        calendar year. Other staff traveling to outbreak- affected locations for CDC missions may
        also need medical clearance for safe country access.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Pre-Deployment Medical Clearance</h2>
<h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
<p>
    Before your appointment, notify the OHC (<a
        href="mailto:deployment@cdc.gov">deployment@cdc.gov</a>) if you have any of the following to
    schedule a phone consultation with an OHC medical provider:
<ul>
    <li>Chronic medical conditions requiring routine follow-up.</li>
    <li>Major surgery within the past 6 months.</li>
    <li>Uncontrolled hypertension.</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease.</li>
    <li>Immune/autoimmune conditions.</li>
    <li>Diabetes.</li>
    <li>Respiratory conditions.</li>
    <li>Pregnancy (including considering pregnancy or breastfeeding).</li>
    <li>Other serious health conditions.</li>
</ul>
During this consultation, you will learn what additional documentation you will need to bring with you to your pre-deployment medical clearance visit. This may include test results or a clearance letter from your regular medical provider(s). Note that the CDC OHC has the final medical say regarding your deployment. In some instances, even with a letter from your regular medical provider, you may not be cleared to deploy. If you have a “higher risk” medical condition, supporting the CDC response with a domestic deployment is one way you can contribute to the agency’s mission while safeguarding your personal health.
</p>
<h2>Respirator Clearance</h2>
<p>If you need to wear a respirator for your job and you are a federal employee or certain category
    of working visitor, you are eligible to be medically cleared at the clinic. If you are a
    contractor, you’re
    medically cleared through your company clinic. Check with your supervisor if you’re not sure of
    your status.</p>
<h2>Foreign Postings or Frequent Travel</h2>
<h3>Department of State (DOS) Medical Clearance</h3>
<p>DOS medical clearance is required for CDC employees posting or traveling internationally for 30
    or more consecutive days and dependents under official orders who are traveling with CDC
    employees. Contact the Center for Global Health (<a href="mailto:cghgam@cdc.gov">cghgam@cdc.gov</a>) to
    determine your need for
    clearance and to receive authorization to move forward with the DOS process. It involves:
<ul>
    <li>Full medical history.</li>
    <li>Physical exam.</li>
    <li>Blood tests.</li>
    <li>Possibly an x-ray, EKG, and notes from your personal physician.</li>
</ul>
The clinic performs physical exams for CDC employees and eligible dependents. You and the Center for Global Health will be notified by DOS when the clearance is official.
</p>
<h2>World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Clearance</h2>
<p>WHO clearance is required for some international deployments; you will be notified if you need
    one. The clinic performs the exam and arranges for all required tests. Submit the completed exam
    form (<a href="mailto:hms@who.int">hms@who.int</a>) that you receive from the clinic and take a
    copy with you on deployment.</p>
