<h1>CDC ClinicTravel Kits</h1>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>You can get a travel kit from the CDC Clinic (OHC) before you leave for official travel. It
        contains medicine and other health items that may be useful during travel. You can also use
        your travel kit to store personal medications.
    </li>
    <li>Leave medicine in its original bottle with the label intact, in case it is examined by
        customs officials. Loose pills or pills in flip-top containers will likely be thrown away by
        customs officials.
    </li>
    <li>Take your travel kit as a carry-on item so you have it with you in case your luggage is lost
        or misplaced. It’s good to be well prepared when traveling overseas – don’t assume that you
        can easily buy safe or familiar medicines while traveling.
