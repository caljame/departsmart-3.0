<h1>The DO's</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Be inconspicuous.</li>
    <li>Keep the device in an inside pocket.</li>
    <li>Use hands-free technology.</li>
    <li>Consider buying anti-theft insurance for the cell phone; but, check first to see if your homeowner’s insurance covers accidental damage, loss, or theft of a cell phone.</li>
    <li>Use encryption to protect data and back up important data.</li>
    <li>Set up GPS tracking on your cell phone.</li>
    <li>Note your serial number and International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID). The serial number can be found under the battery compartment. The IMEI can be
        found by entering #6# into the dial screen of the handset.</li>
    <li>File a police report if your phone is stolen with the phone’s make, model, and electronic serial number, plus the name of the provider. This serves as evidence to the wireless provider and insurance company that the phone was stolen rather than lost. Immediately notify your cell phone provider.</li>
    <li>Reset the phone to its factory settings if your cell phone was stolen or lost and has been found. A malicious app or spyware may have been added. If the phone has an “erase everything” option, select it, but note this option deletes items that may be irreplaceable. Contact your provider for assistance.</li>
    <li>Get a strong wristband for the wireless device.</li>
    <li>Password-protect your cell phone, which makes it difficult for thieves to retrieve data. Also, set your phone so that it automatically goes into this mode.</li>
    <li>Use PIN codes to unlock the phone.</li>
    <li>Install an anti-theft app.</li>
    <li>Use an anti-theft cell phone security pouch or case.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The DON'Ts</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Display your wireless device; if you must, hold it with both hands.</li>
    <li>Listen to music in public. It can be distracting, leaving you vulnerable. If you must listen to music, keep the volume low and/or wear only one earbud.</li>
    <li>Use expensive earbuds or headphones.</li>
    <li>Risk injury by running after a thief to recover a cell phone.</li>
    <li>Tap or squeeze your jacket or pants pocket to check if your electronic device or wallet is still there. This could tip off a thief.</li>
    <li>Lend your cell phone to a stranger; in an emergency, make the call for them.</li>
