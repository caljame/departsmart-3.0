<h1>Personal Safety and Security Responsibilities</h1>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal safety and security is your individual responsibility.</li>
    <li>Exercise caution and common sense while traveling abroad.</li>
    <li>Practice heightened personal security throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    The following are key preparations and actions you and your family members should take while
    traveling:
<ul>

    <li>Keep essential documents such as passports, birth certificates, financial items, etc. in one
        secure location known to all adult family members in case of the need to depart your home
        quickly.
    </li>

    <li>Know the location of safe areas such as police stations, major hotels, and hospitals along
        your daily routes. If you are being followed or harassed, move directly to a safe area and
        call the local police. Never lead the person back to your hotel, or stop and get out or your
        car.
    </li>
    <li>Stay alert to your surroundings, especially suspicious persons or items. If you see
        something suspicious, immediately notify available security personnel and leave the area.
    </li>
    <li>Trust your instincts and use common sense, especially around large crowds that may become
        violent.
    </li>
    <li>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the City of Houston, Texas have produced a
        video entitled “RUN, HIDE, FIGHT” that outlines life-saving actions during an attack. The
        six-minute video can be viewed on YouTube at home at this link: <a

    </li>
    <li>Take note of nearby entrances/exits for quick escape and locations you may use to hide from
        danger if unable to escape. If an emergency situation does occur, notify local law
        enforcement as soon as possible and be prepared to provide your exact location to allow for
        a rapid response.
    </li>
    <li>When rescuers do arrive, keep your hands in plain sight and avoid sudden movements and
        yelling. Lying on the ground with your hands visible is the safest place to be.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid excessive jewelry, electronics, and carrying and flashing large sums of cash. Be wary
        of persons watching you or attempting to rapidly approach your area.
    </li>
    <li>Be prepared to enter your vehicle quickly when walking through parking lots. Stay clear of
        areas that might conceal danger. Check the interior and exterior of your vehicle prior to
        entering.
    </li>
    <li>If robbed, give up your valuables immediately. If your attacker tries to take you away to
        another place, consider fighting back as your life may be in danger.
    </li>
    <li>Do not leave food or drink unattended to avoid being drugged, especially in bars and
        nightclubs.
    </li>
</ul>
