<h1>Counterintelligence Travel Tips</h1>
<h2>Protect What You Know</h2>
<h3>Why Are You a Target?</h3>
<p>
    Many foreign governments and businesses place a high priority on acquiring U.S. Government (USG)
    information. They target USG travelers or even family members to get to it.
</p>
<p>
    Intelligence collectors seek:
<ul>
    <li>U.S. political, economic, industrial, and military information.</li>
    <li>Classified and sensitive government information.</li>
    <li>Proprietary company data.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You may not know what information they are looking for, that helps them identify and pursue even
    more lucrative targets.</p>
<p>Foreign intelligence collectors hope to acquire information surreptitiously and usually do not
    draw attention to the tactics they use.</p>
<p>Only rarely have foreign intelligence collectors stolen a laptop, directly recruited someone, or
    trapped someone in an embarrassing act.
    USG travelers have reported incidents from all over the world. International borders do not
    restrict foreign intelligence collection.</p>
<p>Who else can target you for intelligence collection?
<ul>
    <li>A third country, while the host country is unaware.</li>
    <li>Foreign government ministries unassociated with a country’s intelligence or security
        organizations.
    </li>
    <li>Foreign research institutes.</li>
    <li>Government-sponsored industries.</li>
    <li>Terrorist organizations.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>How Is Intelligence Gathered?</h3>
<h4>Elicitation</h4>
<p>Seemingly normal conversations contrived to get information about you, your work, or your
    colleagues. This is subtle and is not direct questioning by government or industry
    representatives. These methods are designed to:
<ul>
    <li>Put you at ease to share information.</li>
    <li>Be difficult to recognize as intelligence collection.</li>
    <li>Be easily deniable by an adversary if confronted.</li>
</ul>
For example, an intelligence gatherer posing as a scientist at a conference who may even be credentialed in your field of expertise may engage you in conversation to get information from you.
</p>
<h4>Electronic Interception</h4>
<p>Legal or illegal intercept of electronic communication such as cell phones or Bluetooth devices.
    Computers and miniature electronic surveillance equipment are
    low-cost, effective tools to find out more about you than you want to share.
<ul>
    <li>Foreign telecommunications carriers and internet service providers are vulnerable because
        many are government controlled.
    </li>
    <li>Office, hotel, and cell phones are key targets.</li>
    <li>Fax machines and e-mail may be electronically monitored.</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Evesdropping</h4>
<p>Listening to other people’s conversations to gather information. This can range from strategic
    positioning of an unobtrusive bystander to using concealed audio and visual devices.
    Eavesdropping can be used in social settings, public and host-provided transport, restaurants,
    bars, and meeting facility restrooms where you feel secure and are more likely to talk about
    yourself or your work.</p>
<p>Concealed listening and recording devices can also be placed in conference facilities and hotel
    rooms to overhear or record conversations. These are low cost, low risk, and virtually
    undetectable.</p>
<h4>Intrusion</h4>
<p>Physical entry into a room, briefcase, room safe, or electronic equipment to steal or copy
    papers, magnetic and audio media, or install electronic eavesdropping equipment. Most intrusions
    are surreptitious but travelers have reported finding someone searching their belongings or
    conducting unnecessary maintenance.
<ul>
    <li>Hotel intrusions are often done with help from hotel staff.</li>
    <li>When reported, authorities may try to explain away incidents as criminal activity, for
        example, someone seeking passports, cash, and valuables.
    </li>
    <li>Most countries and foreign companies can override commercial computer intrusion-protection
        software and hardware or break commercially available encryption.
    </li>
    </li>
</ul></p>
<h3>How Can You Protect Yourself?</h3>
<p>Awareness, common sense, and basic personal security measures can help to protect you from
    attempts to collect information. Here are some things you can do before, during, and after your
    trip:</p>
<h4>Get Threat Information Before You Go</h4>
<p>Be sure you know your program’s foreign travel procedures and get foreign intelligence threat
    information.</p>
<h4>Keep a Low Profile</h4>
<p>Your behavior overseas could increase your visibility and susceptibility to compromise or loss of
    information. In some cases, it may be hard to
    maintain a low profile. The nature of your travel, such as attending a conference, could
    associate you with a government program or project. Even the clothes you wear may draw
    attention.
<ul>
    <li>Unless required to do so, do not wear clothing with a USG or program logo in public. This
        also reduces your chance of becoming a victim of criminal activity, civil unrest, or
        terrorism.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid using commercial or government encryption programs for e-mails. Some countries may
        interpret encrypted e-mail as being sent by a terrorist, drug trafficker, or criminal.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid associating with people labelled by the USG as dissidents and steer clear of
        demonstrations.
    </li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Be Reserved in Sharing Information</h4>
<p>Unless dealing with security authorities in the host country, such as border police or customs
    officials, avoid providing information that identifies you as a USG traveler.
    <li>
    <li>Provide travel arrangers, drivers, and hotel staff with only the information necessary to
        conduct your transactions.
<li>Do not offer information to anyone not authorized to hear it, including facts about the USG, the
    agency, your work, or personal information about yourself or colleagues.
</li>
<li>Ignore or deflect unwarranted inquiries or intrusive conversations.</li>
<li>Do not discuss classified, sensitive, or proprietary information on public transport, in hotel
    rooms, or other public venues.
</li>
<li>Do not leave classified or sensitive documents or equipment unattended in hotel rooms or hotel
    safes. Use only approved security devices for classified or proprietary information.
</li>
<li>Do not use foreign computers, faxes, or telephones to transmit or discuss classified or
    sensitive company information.
</li></ul></p>
<h4>Report Incidents</h4>
<p>Suspicious incidents should be reported to the nearest U.S. diplomatic authorities.
<ul>
    <li>When in doubt, seek assistance from appropriate local US government security representatives
        or your company.
    </li>
    <li>Do not hesitate to report seemingly minor incidents.</li>
</ul></p>
